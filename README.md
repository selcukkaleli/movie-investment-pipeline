# Movie Investment Intelligence Pipeline

A end-to-end data engineering pipeline that helps content-producing companies make data-driven investment decisions about which movie genres to pursue.

## Problem Statement

Content companies invest millions in genre-specific productions without clear data on long-term audience trends or the relationship between popularity and quality. This pipeline ingests, processes, and visualizes 32 million movie ratings to answer two core business questions:

1. **Which genres have sustained strong audiences over time?**
2. **Does popularity correlate with quality — are the most-watched genres also the most appreciated?**

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure (IaC) | Terraform | Provisions GCS bucket and BigQuery datasets |
| Orchestration | Kestra | End-to-end pipeline orchestration |
| Data Lake | Google Cloud Storage | Raw CSV storage |
| Processing | Apache Spark | Genre exploding, type casting, BigQuery write |
| Data Warehouse | BigQuery | Partitioned + clustered tables |
| Transformation | dbt | Staging → Intermediate → Marts layers |
| Visualization | Looker Studio | 2-tile interactive dashboard |
| Containerization | Docker Compose | Kestra + Spark runtime |

## Dataset

[MovieLens 32M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/) — 32 million ratings across 87,000+ movies by 200,000+ users. Published by GroupLens Research.

## Data Warehouse Design

The BigQuery table `raw.ratings_with_genres` is:
- **Partitioned by MONTH** on `rating_timestamp` — enables efficient time-based queries and reduces scanned data
- **Clustered by genre** — optimizes genre-level aggregations used throughout the dbt models

This design directly supports the upstream analytical queries: filtering by time period and grouping by genre.

## dbt Transformations
```
models/
├── staging/
│   └── stg_ratings_with_genres.sql     # Rename columns, type casting
├── intermediate/
│   └── int_genre_ratings.sql           # Aggregate by genre + year, deduplicate ratings
└── marts/
    ├── mart_genre_trends.sql            # Genre audience trends over time → Line chart
    └── mart_quality_vs_popularity.sql   # Popularity vs quality by genre → Scatter chart
```

Key transformation decisions:
- Ratings are deduplicated using `COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(user_id, '_', movie_id))` per genre to avoid double-counting from the genre explode step
- Genres with value `(no genres listed)` are excluded from marts

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- GCP account with billing enabled
- Docker Desktop (8GB memory recommended)
- Terraform
- Python + pip

### Step 1 — GCP Setup

1. Create a GCP project and enable the following APIs:
   - Cloud Storage API
   - BigQuery API
2. Create a service account with **Storage Admin** and **BigQuery Admin** roles
3. Download the JSON key and place it at `credentials/gcp-key.json`

### Step 2 — Infrastructure
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This provisions:
- GCS bucket: `movie-investment-pipeline-data-lake`
- BigQuery datasets: `raw`, `analytics`, `analytics_staging`, `analytics_intermediate`, `analytics_marts`

### Step 3 — Configure Kestra

1. Start Kestra:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
2. Open Kestra UI at `http://localhost:8080`
3. Go to **KV Store** and add the key `GCP_CREDS` with the contents of your `credentials/gcp-key.json`
4. Upload the flow from `kestra/flows/01_ingest_movielens.yml`
5. Run the flow — it will download MovieLens 32M, upload CSVs to GCS, and trigger the Spark job

> **Note:** The download step (`download_unzip_upload` task) downloads ~300MB. If you want to skip it and use pre-existing GCS data, you can disable that task in the flow.

### Step 4 — Run Spark Job (if running manually)
```bash
docker compose run --rm spark spark-submit \
  --driver-memory 4g \
  --executor-memory 4g \
  /opt/spark/work/genre_explode.py
```

This reads CSVs from GCS, explodes pipe-separated genres, joins ratings with movies, and writes the result to `BigQuery raw.ratings_with_genres`.

### Step 5 — dbt Transformations
```bash
pip install dbt-bigquery

# Configure profiles.yml
dbt init  # follow prompts: bigquery, service_account, project=movie-investment-pipeline, dataset=analytics, location=us-central1

cd dbt/movie_pipeline
dbt run
```

### Step 6 — Dashboard

Open the [live dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/14670535-447b-425a-978a-8803f1f2ffa9/page/UsrsF) or connect your own Looker Studio report to:
- `analytics_marts.mart_genre_trends`
- `analytics_marts.mart_quality_vs_popularity`
